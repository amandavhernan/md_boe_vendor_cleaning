    "1. The first step I took to clean the vendor names was duplicating the original \"Payee Name\" column to start working in. Then, I removed all of the punctuation by using str.replace and the regular expression, [^\\w\\s]+, to replace all punctuation characters with an empty string. Then, I trained the dedupe library to check for vendor name duplicates. The library standardized/clustered the vendors and created two new columns in the dataframe; \"cluster id\" and \"confidence.\" After checking the dataframe, I converted all of the cleaned vendor names to uppercase. Then, I exported the clean dataset into the data folder as a CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The hardest part of standardizing this data was learning how to use the dedupe library. It was tricky at first because I didn't fully understand how to train it, but after consulting a few tutorials I got the hang of it. It's actually a lot easier to use compared to some of the other libraries I found online. When I started training the library, I found myself also Googling the vendor names to determine whether they might be the same or not. This wasn't a difficult step, but it actually helped me learn more about some of the vendors and the services they provide.\n",

    "3. In total, there are 1,073 unique vendors. One of the first things I noticed is that some years are missing payment amount data. I would like to know if there's a valid reason for that, but I suspect that there probably isn't. I also noticed that the county paid several different bus services, which is likely a result of the bus driver shortage. Lastly, I thought it was interesting how the county's payments to the College Board increased by ~20% from 2020 to 2022. I did some digging and found that the county pledged to cover some of the costs of AP exams and other tests to provide more opportunities to students.\n",
